      <p>
        Neighborly is a decentralized platform for neighbors to help each other with small tasks and services. 
        Instead of money, we use a community token that is generated when help is provided, creating a circular 
        economy based on reciprocity and trust.

        This project utilizes blockchain technology (Polygon/Sepolia), smart contracts, and decentralized principles 
        to build a stronger, more connected local community.
